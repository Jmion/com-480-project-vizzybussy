                        <p class="text-justify"></p>Nowadays, movies are part of everyone’s life. Whether you’re young
                        or old, you prefer watching
                        your favorite movie at home or the theater, alone or with other people. You might like watching
                        movies just for the sake of fun and relax, and see that as a bonding activity with your friends
                        and family. Movies might be your way to temporarily escape from real life and problems that
                        surround you. Or you might be more serious movie lover, which appreciates movies as an art form
                        and always tries to learn lessons and acquire knowledge and inspiration from them. Whichever
                        group you belong to, you will find something intriguing in our visualization.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify"></p>Movie making is a visual art and visual entertainment on its own. We
                        would all rather watch the
                        latest blockbuster then look at the statistics about it, right? But we’ve discovered that
                        visualizing the data about the movies can be fun as well. With this data story, we want to
                        enable you to <b>discover patterns of what makes a great movie</b>. We are giving you the
                        opportunity
                        to interactively explore the most popular movies of all time, by broadening your knowledge about
                        the evolution of the movie industry and thinking critically about upcoming megahits.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify"></p>To help you get into the core of the most popular movies and the
                        complex relationships that
                        exist between them, we have prepared three visualizations which you can explore. In order to
                        keep the spirit of the topic, we decided to name our visualizations using some of the popular
                        movies which seemed adequate for our graphs. Brace yourself, because “<b>Back to the

                            this visualization is meant for you. In the graph below you will be able to dive into the
                            history of movies an see what movies were the most popular, how much they earned, and how
                            much was the budget to make them. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify"> Here are a few ideas of interesting things to look at. Let’s start with
                            the launch of the
                            largest grossing franchise in history: “Star Wars”. Go to the year 1977, and try to find
                            this historical hit. Incredibly popular right, but the budget (size of the dot) isn’t a lot
                            bigger than the flops of that year. You can observe the same trend with the next star wars
                            movie in 1980. Let’s move on to another classic franchise that started in 1981. Do you have
                            an idea which one we are thinking of? If you had Indiana Jones, you were right. Look at the
                            budget, it’s not the most expensive movie that was made that year but it grossed almost
                            double the revenue in the box office.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify"> Now let’s have a look at some of the biggest hits of all times. Let’s
                            start with E.T in
                            1982, you'll notice that it didn’t have an extravagant budget but that it manage to gross
                            more than 4 times the revenue second best movie that year in the boy office. Let’s finish
                            off with James Cameron legendary hit, Titanic. If you don’t remember the year use the search
                            bar to find it. Titanic shows a different trend than what we observed before. The budget to
                            produce the movie was astronomical, but the return revenue made it the first movie ever to
                            break the 1B$ mark.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify"> We can see that in the 20th century a good movie didn’t have a huge
                            budget.
                            Let’s now look at how things have evolved in the 21st century. Use the timeline control to
                            play through time. We can see a clear trend that the smaller budget movies tend to be less
                            popular and yield les return. To take another great hit made by James Cameron, Avatar,
                            released in 2009. We can observe that it is production budget was one of the largest that
                            year. It was also the first movie ever to gross more than 2B$.</p>

                            genres and see how the genres evolved in the previous half-century. We will also include one
                            more factor in this analysis of the movie history - production houses. Which genre you think

                            when you hear the popular 20th century fox jingle? And can you believe that Walt Disney
                            actually
                            made some thriller movies?</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Choose your starting point: genres or production houses. Then, check how

                            at

                            We
                            found out which production house managed to shine and fall in 10 years, which genre is

                            Let's now focus on actors! At first sight, with the default parameters, we can see several
                            clusters of actors
                            and the biggest is the Harry Potter saga cluster! Can you remember the name of the actors
                            behind your favorite
                            characters? If not, it's time to refresh your memory and discover what the actors did apart
                            from this saga (yes,
                            they are not only wizards) by right-clicking on the nodes.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            If you want to find your favorite actor, try to write his name in the input box and see if
                            it's in our dataset! If
                            it is not, try to decrease the minimal number of common movies between actors, for example
                            let's go big and select 3.
                            Try to look for Ian McKellen and you will see how connected he is with several clusters.
                            After right-clicking on the
                            edges we discover that he's one of the key connections between the Hobbit's saga and Lord Of
                            The Rings' saga, make sense right when you are Gandalf.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            At the other edge case (10 common movies at least), looking for actors that work a lot
                            together we find an iconic duo
                            Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson who played together in well-know/classic comedy movies such as
                            Starsky & Hutch, Night at the Museum's saga
                            and main roles in the Fockers' family.

                        <p>
                            Are you ready to sharpen your knowledge of actors?

                            beginning - <b>which conclusions and connections did you pull from our movie visualization?</b>
                            From a
                            historical point of view, movies represent a reflection of our society and our culture. As
                            society changed, the movies changed as well, and by looking at the characteristics of the
                            most
                            popular movies of all time, we believe that we could see some interesting patterns and
                            insights.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Although we sometimes watch movies just because they are exciting,
                            thrilling and fun, their
                            value is undoubtedly in acquiring ideas and lessons that we can apply in real life. We would
                            love that the same applies to the data story we created - we hope that you enjoyed the
                            interface
                            and had fun trying out the interactions, but that you also gained knowledge and found
